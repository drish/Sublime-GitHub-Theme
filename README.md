Sublime-GitHub-Theme
======================

GitHub Code Highlighting theme for sublime lovers.

This is the theme I use, especially for JavaScript coding.
It's based on [this one](https://github.com/sbecker/github_editor_theme)
However, I've edited some things. 

Install :

``` $ cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages && git clone https://github.com/drish/Sublime-GitHub-Theme.git ```
